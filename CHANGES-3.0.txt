NiCad3 has undergone a number of changes to increase
convenience, speed and accuracy from previous versions.

- Results are now reported as clone pairs rather than
  clone classes.  Accuracy is improved as a result.
  Clone pairs are reported in largest-to-smallest order.

- Clone pairs are now reported with their near-miss
  similarity percentage, e.g. similarity="90" means 
  90% of pretty-printed, normalized lines are the same.

- Clone pairs entirely embedded in larger clone pairs
  are now accurately removed from the results.

- Clone classes can optionally be requested using the 
  "cluster=yes" configuration parameter. Clusters are
  now reported as the largest set of clone pairs for
  which every source fragment is within the threshold 
  distance of at least one other member of the set.

- HTML reports are now only created on request, using
  the "report=yes" configuation parameter.

- Default clone size range is now 10-1000 lines rather
  than 5-500.  Minimum clone size of 5 yields 
  irrelevant results, particularly for blocks,
  and there is really no reason for a maximum size.
  The range can still be controlled by configuration
  parameters "min=NN" and "max=MM".

- The NiCad command has been changed to "nicad3"
  to remind you it is not like original NiCad.
