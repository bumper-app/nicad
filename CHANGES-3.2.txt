Changes from NiCad 3.1 in 3.2

1. Maximum clone size has been raised to 20,000 lines, 
   and the default maximum in distributed configurations 
   to 2,500 lines.

2. All scripts and Makefiles updated to automatically adapt
   to new languages, granularities and plugins.  

   To add a new language, simply add a TXL extractor for 
   the language and desired granularity.

   For example, to add handling of Javascript, just add the 
   grammar and extractor granularity files for the new language:

	txl/js.grm
	txl/js-extract-functions.txl

   Then type "make".  The new language can then be immediately
   processed with no changes to any scripts or Makefiles,
   for example:

	nicad3 functions js my-javascript-source-dir type2

   To add a new granularity, simply add a TXL extractor for
   the new granularity.

   For example, to add handling of Java class clones, just
   add the extractor for Java classes:

	txl/java-extract-classes.txl

   Then type "make".  The new granularity can then be immediately
   processed with no changes to any scripts or Makefiles, 
   for example:

	nicad3 classes java my-java-source-dir type2
