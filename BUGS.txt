Please report any bugs or problems with NiCad3 in the TXL Forum,

    http://www.txl.ca/forum/viewforum.php?f=21

Known Issues:
-------------

1. Syntax Errors
   -------------
   In order to do its work, NiCad parses all source files.  
   Most systems will have some files with real syntax errors in them,
   so do not be alarmed by a small number of "failed to parse"
   files, that is normal and expected.  

   However, if you get a large number of parse errors (more than 1%), 
   please report details of the problem in the NiCad section of 
   the TXL Forum so that the grammars can be improved.

2. Directory Names with Spaces
   ---------------------------
   Some non-Linux systems have directories with spaces in them. 
   These present a problem for the NiCad scripts, which use
   find(1) to navigate large directories of source.

   To process systems like this, first run the "fixspaces" command
   in the nicad home directory on the system source.  For example:

      fixspaces systems/c/thesystem

3. Output is not pure XML
   ----------------------
  The output of NiCad is in its own simple markup format based
  on XML, but is not pure XML. In particular, it is missing the
  XML schema header line. However, it is close enough that it
  should be acceptable to any XML editor.

  When source is included in the results (the "withsource" 
  output produced by the "report=yes" configuration option),
  source fragments may cause problems for XML editors.
  However, the HTML format of the results is pure XHTML
  and should be acceptable to any web browser.
