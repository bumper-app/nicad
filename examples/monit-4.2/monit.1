.IX Title "MONIT 1"
.TH MONIT 1 "www.tildeslash.com" "March 24. 2004" "User Commands"
.SH "NAME"
monit \- utility for monitoring services on a Unix system
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBmonit\fR [options] {arguments}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBmonit\fR is a utility for managing and monitoring processes,
files, directories and devices on a Unix system. Monit conducts
automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful
causal actions in error situations. E.g. monit can start a
process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not
respond and stop a process if it uses to much resources. You may
use monit to monitor files, directories and devices for changes,
such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes.
.PP
Monit is controlled via an easy to configure control file based
on a free\-format, token-oriented syntax. Monit logs to syslog or
to its own log file and notifies you about error conditions via
customizable alert messages. Monit can perform various \s-1TCP/IP\s0
network checks, protocol checks and can utilize \s-1SSL\s0 for such
checks. Monit provides a http(s) interface and you may use a
browser to access the monit program.
.SH "GENERAL OPERATION"
.IX Header "GENERAL OPERATION"
The behavior of monit is controlled by command-line options
\&\fIand\fR a run control file, \fI~/.monitrc\fR, the syntax of which we
describe in a later section. Command-line options override
\&\fI.monitrc\fR declarations.
.PP
The following options are recognized by monit. However, it is
recommended that you set options (when applicable) directly in
the \fI.monitrc\fR control file.
.Sh "General Options and Arguments"
.IX Subsection "General Options and Arguments"
\&\fB\-c\fR \fIfile\fR
   Use this control file
.PP
\&\fB\-d\fR \fIn\fR
   Run as a daemon once per \fIn\fR seconds
.PP
\&\fB\-g\fR 
   Set group name for start, stop, restart and status
.PP
\&\fB\-l\fR \fIlogfile\fR
   Print log information to this file 
.PP
\&\fB\-p\fR \fIpidfile\fR

.PP
In addition to the options above, monit can be started with one
of the following action arguments; monit will then execute the
action and exit without transforming itself to a daemon.
.PP
\&\fBstart all\fR
   Start all services listed in the control file and 
   enable monitoring for them. If the group option is 
   set, only start and enable monitoring of services in
   the named group.
.PP
\&\fBstart name\fR
   Start the named service and enable monitoring for 
   it. The name is a service entry name from the 
   monitrc file.
.PP
\&\fBstop all\fR     
   Stop all services listed in the control file and 
   disable their monitoring. If the group option is 
   set, only stop and disable monitoring of the services 
   in the named group.
.PP
\&\fBstop name\fR
   Stop the named service and disable its monitoring. 
   The name is a service entry name from the monitrc 
   file. 
.PP
\&\fBrestart all\fR
   Stop and start \fIall\fR services. If the group option 
   is set, only restart the services in the named group.
.PP
\&\fBrestart name\fR
   Restart the named service. The name is a service entry 
   name from the monitrc file.
.PP
\&\fBmonitor all\fR     
   Enable monitoring of all services listed in the
   control file. If the group option is set, only start
   monitoring of services in the named group.
.PP
\&\fBmonitor name\fR
   Enable monitoring of the named service.  The name is
   a service entry name from the monitrc file. Monit will
   also enable monitoring of all services this service 
   depends on.
.PP
\&\fBunmonitor all\fR     
   Disable monitoring of all services listed in the
   control file. If the group option is set, only disable
   monitoring of services in the named group.
.PP
\&\fBunmonitor name\fR
   Disable monitoring of the named service. The name is
   a service entry name from the monitrc file. Monit 
   will also disable monitoring of all services that 
   depends on this service.
.PP
\&\fBstatus\fR
    Print status information for each service.
.PP
\&\fBreload\fR
    Reinitialize a running monit daemon, the daemon will
    reread its configuration, close and reopen log files.
.PP
\&\fBquit\fR
    Kill a monit daemon process
.PP
\&\fBvalidate\fR
   Check all services listed in the control file. This 
   action is also the default behavior when monit runs 
   in daemon mode.
.SH "WHAT TO MONITOR"
.IX Header "WHAT TO MONITOR"
You may use monit to monitor daemon processes or similar programs
running on localhost. Monit is particular useful for monitoring
daemon processes, such as those started at system boot time from
/etc/init.d/. For instance sendmail, sshd, apache and mysql. In
difference to many monitoring systems, monit can act if an error
situation should occur, e.g.; if sendmail is not running, monit
can start sendmail or if apache is using to much system resources
(e.g. if a DoS attack is in progress) monit can stop or restart
apache and send you an alert message. Monit does also monitor
process characteristics, such as; if a process has become a
zombie and how much memory or cpu cycles a process is using.
.PP
You may also use monit to monitor files, directories and devices
on localhost. Monit can monitor these items for changes, such as
timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes. This is
also useful for security reasons \- you can monitor the md5
checksum of files that should not change.
.PP
You may even use monit to monitor remote hosts. First and
foremost monit is a utility for monitoring and mending services
on localhost, but if a service depends on a remote service,
e.g. a database server or an application server, it might by
useful to be able to test a remote host as well.
.SH "HOW TO MONITOR"
.IX Header "HOW TO MONITOR"
monit is configured and controlled via a control file called
\&\fBmonitrc\fR. The default location for this file is ~/.monitrc. If
this file does not exist, monit will try /etc/monitrc and finally
\&./monitrc.
.PP
A monit control file consists of a series of service entries and
global option statements in a free\-format, token-oriented syntax.
Comments begin with a # and extend through the end of the line.
There are three kinds of tokens in the control file: grammar
keywords, numbers and strings.
.PP
On a semantic level, the control file consists of three types of
statements:
.IP "1. Global set-statements" 4
.IX Item "1. Global set-statements"
A global set-statement starts with the keyword \fIset\fR and the
item to configure.
.IP "2. Global include-statement" 4
.IX Item "2. Global include-statement"
The include statement consists of the keyword \fIinclude\fR and
a glob string.
.IP "3. One or more service entry statements." 4
.IX Item "3. One or more service entry statements."
A service entry starts with the keyword \fIcheck\fR followed by the
service type. 
.PP
This is the hello galaxy version of a monit control file:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& #
\& # monit control file
\& #
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 6
\& set daemon 120 # Poll at 2-minute intervals
\& set logfile syslog facility log_daemon
\& set alert foo@bar.baz
\& set httpd port 2812 and use address localhost
\&     allow localhost   # Allow localhost to connect
\&     allow admin:monit # Allow Basic Auth
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 11
\& check process apache 
\&    with pidfile "/usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid"
\&    start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&    stop program = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&    if 2 restarts within 3 cycles then timeout
\&    if totalmem > 100 Mb then alert
\&    if children > 255 for 5 cycles then stop
\&    if cpu usage > 95% for 3 cycles then restart
\&    if failed port 80 protocol http then restart
\&    group server
\&    depends on httpd.conf, httpd.bin
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check file httpd.conf 
\&     with path /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
\&     # Restart apache if the httpd.conf file was changed
\&     if failed checksum 
\&        then exec "/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful"
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check file httpd.bin 
\&     with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
\&     # Alert and unmonitor apache if the binary was changed
\&     if failed checksum then unmonitor
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\& include /etc/monit/mysql.monitrc
\& include /etc/monit/mail/*.monitrc
.Ve
.PP
This example illustrate a service entry for monitoring the apache
web server process as well as related files. The meaning of the
various statements will be explained in the following sections.
.SH "LOGGING"
.IX Header "LOGGING"
monit will log status and error messages to a log file. If
\&\fBsyslog\fR is given as a value for the \fI\-l\fR command-line switch
(or the keyword \fIset logfile syslog\fR is found in the control
file) monit will use the \fBsyslog\fR system daemon to log
messages. To turn off logging, simply do not set the logfile in
the control file (and of course, do not use the \-l switch)
.SH "DAEMON MODE"
.IX Header "DAEMON MODE"
The \fI\-d interval\fR command-line switch runs monit in daemon
mode. You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling
interval in seconds.
.PP
In daemon mode, monit detaches from the console, puts itself in
the background and runs continuously, monitoring each specified
service and then goes to sleep for the given poll interval.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&       Simply invoking
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&              monit -d 300
.Ve
.PP
will poll all services described in your \fI~/.monitrc\fR file every
5 minutes.
.PP
It is possible and also strongly recommended to set the poll
interval in your ~/.monitrc file by using 'set daemon \fBn\fR',
where \fBn\fR is an integer number of seconds.  If you do this,
monit will always start in daemon mode (as long as no action
arguments are given).
.PP
Monit makes a per-instance lockfile in daemon mode. If you need
more monit instances, you will need more configuration files,
each pointing to its own lockfile.
.PP
Calling monit with a monit daemon running in the background sends
a wakeup signal to the daemon, forcing it to check services
immediately.
.PP
The \fIquit\fR argument will kill a running daemon process instead
of waking it up.
.SH "INIT SUPPORT"
.IX Header "INIT SUPPORT"
Monit can run and be controlled from \fIinit\fR. If monit should
crash, \fIinit\fR will re-spawn a new monit process. Using init to
start monit is probably the best way to run monit if you want to
be certain that you always have a running monit daemon on your
system. (It's obvious, but never the less worth to stress; Make
sure that the control file does not have any syntax errors before
you start monit from init. Also, make sure that if you run monit
from init, that you do not start monit from a startup scripts as
well).
.PP
To setup monit to run from init, you can either use the 'set
init' statement in monit's control file or use the \-I option from
the command line. Here is a sample /etc/inittab entry for monit:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # Run monit in standard run-levels
\&  mo:2345:respawn:/usr/local/bin/monit -Ic /etc/monitrc
.Ve
.PP
After you have modified init's configuration file, you can run
the following command to re-examine /etc/inittab and start monit:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  telinit q
.Ve
.PP
For systems without telinit:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  kill -1 1
.Ve
.PP
If monit is used to monitor services that are also started at
boot time (e.g. services started via \s-1SYSV\s0 init rc scripts or via
inittab) then in some situations a race condition can occur. That
is; if a service is slow to start, monit can assume that the
service is not running and possibly try to start it and raise an
alert, while, in fact the service is already about to start or
already in its startup sequence. Please see the \s-1FAQ\s0 for solutions
to this problem.
.SH "INCLUDE FILES"
.IX Header "INCLUDE FILES"
The monit control file, \fImonitrc\fR, can include additional files.
This feature helps to maintain a certain structure or to place
repeating settings into one file. Include statements can be
placed at virtually any spot. The syntax is the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  INCLUDE globstring
.Ve
.PP
The globstring is any kind of string as defined in \fIglob\fR\|(7).
Thus, you can refer to a single file or you can load several
files at once.  In case you want to use whitespace in your string
the globstring need to be embedded into quotes (') or double
quotes ("). For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  INCLUDE "/etc/monit/monit configuration files/printer.*.monitrc"
.Ve
.PP
loads any file matching the single globstring.  If the globstring
matches a directory instead of a file, it is silently ignored.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1INCLUDE\s0\fR statements in included files are parsed as in the main
control file.  
.PP
If the globstring matches several results, the files are included
in a non sorted manner.  If you need to rely on a certain order,
you might need to use single \fIinclude\fR statements.
.SH "GROUP SUPPORT"
.IX Header "GROUP SUPPORT"
Service entries in the control file, \fImonitrc\fR, can be grouped
together by the \fIgroup\fR statement. The syntax is simply (keyword
in capital):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  GROUP groupname
.Ve
.PP
With this statement it is possible to group similar service
entries together and manage them as a whole. Monit provides
functions to start, stop and restart a group of services, like
so:
.PP
To start a group of services from the console:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit -g <groupname> start
.Ve
.PP
To stop a group of services:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit -g <groupname> stop
.Ve
.PP
To restart a group of services:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit -g <groupname> restart
.Ve
.SH "MONITORING MODE"
.IX Header "MONITORING MODE"
Monit supports three monitoring modes per service: \fIactive\fR,
\&\fIpassive\fR and \fImanual\fR. See also the example section below for
usage of the mode statement.
.PP
In \fIactive\fR mode, monit will monitor a service and in case of
problems monit will act and raise alerts, start, stop or restart
the service. Active mode is the default mode.
.PP
In \fIpassive\fR mode, monit will passively monitor a service and
specifically \fBnot\fR try to fix a problem, but it will still raise
alerts in case of a problem.
.PP
For use in clustered environments there is also a \fImanual\fR
mode. In this mode, monit will enter \fIactive\fR mode \fBonly\fR if a
service was brought under monit's control, for example by
executing the following command in the console:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  monit start sybase 
\&  (monit will call sybase's start method and enable monitoring)
.Ve
.PP
If a service was not started by monit or was stopped or disabled
for example by:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  monit stop sybase 
\&  (monit will call sybase's stop method and disable monitoring)
.Ve
.PP
monit will not monitor the service. This allows for having
services configured in monitrc and start it with monit only if it
should run. This feature can be used to build a simple failsafe
cluster. To see how, read more about how to setup a cluster with
monit using the \fIheartbeat\fR system in the examples sections
below.
.SH "ALERT MESSAGES"
.IX Header "ALERT MESSAGES"
monit will raise an email alert if:
.PP
.Vb 12
\& o A service timed out
\& o A service was stopped
\& o A port connection failed
\& o A resource statement match
\& o A permission error occurred
\& o A file checksum was changed
\& o A timestamp test didn't pass
\& o A file size test didn't pass
\& o A service was started or restarted
\& o A file/directory/device uid error occurred
\& o A file/directory/device gid error occurred
\& o Monitoring of a service was disabled (unmonitor)
.Ve
.PP
You should use an alert statement to notify monit that you want
alert messages sent to an email address. If you do not specify an
alert statement, monit will not send alert messages.
.PP
There are two forms of alert statement:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& o Global - common for all services
\& o Local  - per service
.Ve
.PP
In both cases you can use more than one alert statement. In other
words, you can send many different emails to many different
addresses. (Just to make it clear, in case you now got a new
business idea; monit is not suitable for sending spam).
.PP
Recipients in the global and in the local lists are alerted when
an error event occurs. If the same email address is in the global
and in the local list, monit will still only send one alert.
Local (per service) defined alert email addresses override global
addresses in case of a conflict. Finally, you may choose to only
use a global alert list, a local per service list or both.
.PP
The full syntax for the alert statement is as follows (keywords
are in capital):
.Sh "Setting a global alert statement"
.IX Subsection "Setting a global alert statement"
In case of an event on any monitored service monit will send an
alert to recipients in the global list which have registred
interest for the event type.
.IP "\s-1SET\s0 \s-1ALERT\s0 mail-address [{events}] [\s-1MAIL\-FORMAT\s0 {mail\-format}]" 4
.IX Item "SET ALERT mail-address [{events}] [MAIL-FORMAT {mail-format}]"
.PP
Simply using the following in the global section of monitrc:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set alert foo@bar
.Ve
.PP
will send a default email to the address foo@bar whenever an
event occurred on any service. Such an event may be that a
service timed out, a service was started or stopped and so on.
.Sh "Setting a local alert statement"
.IX Subsection "Setting a local alert statement"
Each service can have its own recipient list.
.IP "\s-1ALERT\s0 mail-address [{events}] [\s-1MAIL\-FORMAT\s0 {mail\-format}]" 4
.IX Item "ALERT mail-address [{events}] [MAIL-FORMAT {mail-format}]"
.PP
If you only want an alert message sent for certain events for
certain service(s), for example only for timeout events or only
if a service was restarted, then postfix the alert-statement
with a filter block, respectively:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check process myproc with pidfile /var/run/my.pid
\&  ...
\&  alert foo@bar only on { timeout } and 
\&  alert foo@bar only on { restart }
.Ve
.PP
(\fIonly\fR and \fIon\fR are noise keywords, ignored by monit. As a
side note; Noise keywords are used in the control file grammar to
make an entry resemble English and thus make it easier to read
(or, so goes the philosophy). The full set of available noise
keywords are listed below in the Control File section)
.PP
It is also possible to combine alert events and send mail to
different email addresses depending on the events. Like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& alert foo@bar { restart, timeout, resource, connection }
\& alert security@bar on { checksum, permission, uid, gid, stop }
\& alert manager@bar
.Ve
.PP
This will send an alert message to foo@bar whenever a restart,
timeout, resource or connection error occurs and a message to
security@bar if a checksum, permission, uid, gid or stop error
occurs.  And finally, a message to manager@bar whenever any error
event occurs.
.PP
The following alert\-statement:
.PP
.Vb 13
\& alert foo@bar {uid
\&                gid
\&                size
\&                stop
\&                start
\&                restart

.Ve
.PP
The following example will alert foo@bar on all events on all
services by default, except the service mybar which will send an
alert only on timeout. The trick is based on the fact that local
definition of the same recipient overrides the global setting
(including registered events and mail format):
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
.Vb 1
\& check process myfoo with pidfile /var/run/myfoo.pid

.Sh "Alert message layout"
.IX Subsection "Alert message layout"
monit provides a default mail message layout that is short and to
the point. Here's an example of a standard alert mail sent by
monit:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& From: monit@tildeslash.com
\& Subject: monit alert -- Restarted apache 
\& To: hauk@tildeslash.com
\& Date: Thu, 04 Sep 2003 02:33:03 +0200
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Restarted Service apache
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2

\&        Host: www.tildeslash.com
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\& Your faithful employee,
\& monit
.Ve
.PP
If you want to, you can change the format of this message with
the optional \fImail-format\fR statement. The syntax for this
statement is as follows:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& mail-format {
\&      from: monit@localhost
\&   subject: $SERVICE $EVENT at $DATE
\&   message: Monit restarted $SERVICE at $DATE on $HOST. 
\&            Yours sincerely,
\&            monit
\& }
.Ve
.PP
Where the keyword \fIfrom:\fR is the email address monit should
pretend it is sending from. It does not have to be a real mail
address, but it must be a proper formated mail address, on the
form: name@domain. The keyword \fIsubject:\fR is for the email
subject line. The subject must be on only \fIone\fR line. The
\&\fImessage:\fR keyword denotes the mail body. If used, this keyword
should always be the last in a mail-format statement.  The mail
body can be as long as you want and must \fBnot\fR contain the '}'
character.
.PP
All of these format keywords are optional but you must provide at
least one. Thus if you only want to change the from address monit
is using you can do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& alert foo@bar with mail-format { from: bofh@xyzzy.no }
.Ve
.PP
From the previous example you will notice that 4 special
variables was used. If used, they will be substituted and
expanded into the text with these values:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI$EVENT\fR A string describing the event that occurred. The values
are fixed and are, \*(L"Started\*(R", \*(L"Stopped\*(R", \*(L"Restarted\*(R", Checksum

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI$SERVICE\fR The service entry name in monitrc
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI$DATE\fR The current time and date (\s-1RFC\s0 822 date style).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI$HOST\fR The name of the host monit is running on
.Sh "Setting a global mail format"
.IX Subsection "Setting a global mail format"
Finally, it is possible to set a standard mail format with the
following global set-statement (keywords are in capital):
.IP "\s-1SET\s0 MAIL-FORMAT {mail\-format}" 4
.IX Item "SET MAIL-FORMAT {mail-format}"
.PP
Format set with this statement will apply to every alert
statement that does \fInot\fR have its own specified mail\-format.
This statement is most useful for setting a default from address
for messages sent by monit, like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set mail-format { from: monit@foo.bar.no }
.Ve
.Sh "Setting a mail server for alert messages"
.IX Subsection "Setting a mail server for alert messages"
The mail server monit should use to send alert messages is
defined with a global set statement (keywords are in capital and
optional statements in [brackets]):
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET MAILSERVER {host name|ip-address}+ [with TIMEOUT X SECONDS]
.Ve
.PP
As you can see, it is possible to set several \s-1SMTP\s0 servers and if
monit cannot connect to the first server in the list it will try
the second server and so on. Monit has a default 5 seconds
connection timeout and if the \s-1SMTP\s0 server is slow, monit could
timeout when connecting or reading from the server.  You can use
the optional timeout statement to explicit set the timeout to a
higher value if needed. Here is an example for setting several
mail servers:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& set mailserver mail.tildeslash.com, mail.foo.bar, localhost 
\&     with timeout 15 seconds
.Ve
.PP
Here monit will first try to connect to the server
\&\*(L"mail.tildeslash.com\*(R", if this server is down monit will try
\&\*(L"mail.foo.bar\*(R" and finally \*(L"localhost\*(R". We do also set an
explicit connect and read timeout; If monit cannot connect to the
first \s-1SMTP\s0 server in the list within 15 seconds it will try the
next server and so on. The \fIset mailserver ..\fR statement is
optional and if not defined monit defaults to use localhost as
the \s-1SMTP\s0 server.
.SH "SERVICE TIMEOUT"
.IX Header "SERVICE TIMEOUT"
\&\fBmonit\fR provides a service timeout mechanism for situations
where a service simply refuses to start or respond over a longer
period. In cases like this, and particularly if monit's poll-cycle
is low, monit will simply increase the machine load by trying to
restart the service.
.PP
The timeout mechanism monit provides is based on two variables,
i.e. the number the service has been started and the number of
poll\-cycles. For example, if a service had \fIx\fR restarts within
\&\fIy\fR poll-cycles (where \fIx\fR <= \fIy\fR) then monit will timeout and
not (re)start the service on the next cycle. If a timeout occurs
monit will send you an alert message if you have register
interest for this event. 
.PP
The syntax for the timestamp statement is as follows (keywords
are in capital):
.IP "\s-1IF\s0 \s-1NUMBER\s0 \s-1RESTART\s0 \s-1NUMBER\s0 \s-1CYCLE\s0(S) \s-1THEN\s0 \s-1TIMEOUT\s0" 4
.IX Item "IF NUMBER RESTART NUMBER CYCLE(S) THEN TIMEOUT"
.PP
Where the first number is the number of service restarts and the
second, the number of poll\-cycles. If the number of cycles was
reached without a timeout, the service start-counter is reset to
zero. This provides some granularity to catch exceptional cases
and do a service timeout, but let occasional service start and
restarts happen without having an accumulated timeout.
.PP
Here is an example where monit will timeout (not check the
service) if the service was restarted 2 times within 3 cycles:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if 2 restarts within 3 cycles then timeout
.Ve
.PP
To have monit check the service again after a timeout, run 'monit
monitor service' from the command line. This will remove the
timeout lock in the daemon and make the daemon start and check
the service again.
.SH "SERVICE TESTS"
.IX Header "SERVICE TESTS"
monit provides several if-tests you may utilize in a service
entry to test a service. Each if-test statement is on the
following general format:
.IP "\s-1IF\s0 <\s-1TEST\s0> \s-1THEN\s0 \s-1ACTION\s0" 4
.IX Item "IF <TEST> THEN ACTION"
.PP
If the <\s-1TEST\s0> should validate to true then the selected action is
executed. You must select an action to be executed from this
list:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1ALERT\s0\fR sends the user an alert event.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1RESTART\s0\fR restarts the service \fIand\fR sends an alert. Restart is
conducted by first calling the service's registered stop method
and then the service's start method.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1STOP\s0\fR stops the service by calling the service's registered stop
method \fIand\fR send an alert. If monit stops a service it will not
be checked by monit anymore nor restarted again later. To
reactivate monitoring of the service again you must explicitly
enable monitoring from the web interface or from the console,
e.g. 'monit monitor apache'.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1EXEC\s0\fR may be used to execute an arbitrary program \fIand\fR send
an alert. If you choose this action you must state the program to
be executed and if the program require arguments you must enclose
the program and its arguments in a quoted string. You may
optionally specify the uid and gid the executed program should
switch to upon start. For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& exec "/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh"
\&      as uid nobody and gid nobody
.Ve
.Sp
This may be useful if the program to be started cannot change to
a lesser privileged user and group. This is typically needed for
Java Servers. Remember, if monit is run by the superuser, then
all programs executed by monit will be started with superuser
privileges unless the uid and gid extension was used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\fR will disable monitoring of the service \fIand\fR send
an alert. The service will not be checked by monit anymore nor
restarted again later.  To reactivate monitoring of the service
you must explicitly enable monitoring from monit's web interface
or from the console using the monitor argument.
.Sh "\s-1RESOURCE\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "RESOURCE TESTING"
Monit can examine how much system resources a service or the
system is using. This test may only be used within a process
service entry in the monit control file.
.PP
Depending on process characteristics, services can be stopped or
restarted and alerts can be generated. Thus it is possible to
utilize systems which are idle and to spare system under high
load.
.PP
The full syntax for the resource-statements used for resource
testing is as follows (keywords are in capital and optional
statements in [brackets]),
.IP "\s-1IF\s0 resource operator value [cycles] \s-1THEN\s0 action" 4

\&\*(L"equal\*(R", \*(L"notequal\*(R" in human readable form (if not specified,
default is \s-1EQUAL\s0).
.PP
\&\fIvalue\fR is either an integer or a real number (except for
\&\s-1CHILDREN\s0). For \s-1CPU\s0, \s-1MEMORY\s0 and \s-1TOTALMEMORY\s0 you need to specify a
\&\fIunit\fR.  This could be \*(L"%\*(R" or if applicable \*(L"B\*(R" (Byte), \*(L"kB\*(R"
(1024 Byte), \*(L"\s-1MB\s0\*(R" (1024 KiloByte) or \*(L"\s-1GB\s0\*(R" (1024 MegaByte).
.PP
\&\fIcycles\fR is the maximum number of cycles the expression above
has to be true in order to start an action. To specify the number
of cycles you must state a number followed by the keyword \s-1CYCLES\s0.
If \fIcycles\fR is omitted then the default is one cycle.
.PP
\&\fIaction\fR is a choice of \*(L"\s-1ALERT\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1RESTART\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1STOP\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1EXEC\s0\*(R" or
\&\*(L"\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\*(R".
.PP
To calculate the cycles, a counter is raised whenever the
expression above is true and it is lowered whenever it is false
(but not below 0). All counters are reset in case of a restart.
.PP
The following is an example to check that the \s-1CPU\s0 usage of a
service is not going beyond 50% during five poll cycles. If it
does, monit will restart the service:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if cpu is greater than 50% for 5 cycles then restart
.Ve
.PP
See also the example section below.
.Sh "\s-1FILE\s0 \s-1CHECKSUM\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "FILE CHECKSUM TESTING"
If specified in the control file, monit will compute a md5
checksum for a file. The checksum is used to verify that a file
does not change. The checksum statement may only be used in a
file service entry.
.PP
The full syntax for the checksum statement is as follows:
(keywords are in capital)
.IP "\s-1IF\s0 \s-1FAILED\s0 [MD5|SHA1] \s-1CHECKSUM\s0 [\s-1EXPECT\s0 checksum] \s-1THEN\s0 action" 4
.IX Item "IF FAILED [MD5|SHA1] CHECKSUM [EXPECT checksum] THEN action"
.PP
The choice of \s-1MD5\s0 or \s-1SHA1\s0 is optional.  \s-1MD5\s0 features a 256 bit 
and \s-1SHA1\s0 a 320 bit checksum.  If this option is omitted monit 
tries to guess the method from the \s-1EXPECT\s0 string or uses \s-1MD5\s0 as
default.
.PP
\&\fIexpect\fR is optional and if used it specifies a md5 or sha1 
string monit should expect when testing a file's checksum. 
If \fIexpect\fR is used, monit will not compute an initial checksum 
for the file, but instead use the string you submit. For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& if failed checksum and 
\&    expect the sum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
You can, for example, use the \s-1GNU\s0 utility \fI\fImd5sum\fI\|(1)\fR or 
\&\fI\fIsha1sum\fI\|(1)\fR to create a checksum string for a file and 
use this string in the expect\-statement.

\&\*(L"\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\*(R"
.PP
The checksum statement may be used to check a file for changes
and if changed, do a specified action. For instance to reload a
server if its configuration file was changed. The following
illustrate this for the apache web server:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check file httpd.conf path /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
\&     if failed sha1 checksum 
\&        then exec "/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful"
.Ve
.PP
If you plan to use the checksum statement for security reasons,
(a very good idea, by the way) and to monitor a file or files
which should not change, then please also read the \s-1DEPENDENCY\s0
\&\s-1TREE\s0 section below to see a detailed example on how to do this
properly.
.PP
Monit can also test the checksum for files on a remote host via
the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol. See the \s-1CONNECTION\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0 section below.
.Sh "\s-1TIMESTAMP\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "TIMESTAMP TESTING"
Monit can monitor files and directories for timestamp changes. A
timestamp test may only be used within a file or in a directory
entry in the monit control file.
.PP
The timestamp statement comes in two flavors. The first and basic
version is simply to test an existing file for timestamp changes
and if changed, execute an action. The second, and more compound,
version is used to test a file or directory for various timestamp
changes.

\&\*(L"\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\*(R".
.PP
The basic timestamp statement is useful for checking a file for
changes and then execute an action. This version was written
particularly with configuration files in mind. For instance, if
you monitor the apache web server you can use this statement to
reload apache if the \fIhttpd.conf\fR (apache's configuration file)
was changed. Like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check file httpd.conf with path /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
\&   if timestamp was changed
\&      then exec "/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful"
.Ve
.PP
The second timestamp version is useful for monitoring systems
able to report its state by changing the timestamp of certain
state files. For instance the \fIiPlanet Messaging server stored
process\fR system updates the timestamp of:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& o stored.ckp
\& o stored.lcu
\& o stored.per
.Ve
.PP
If a task should fail, the system keeps the timestamp. To report
stored problems you can use the following statements:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check file stored.ckp with path /msg-foo/config/stored.ckp
\&   if timestamp > 1 minute then alert
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check file stored.lcu with path /msg-foo/config/stored.lcu
\&   if timestamp 5 minutes then alert
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check file stored.per with path /msg-foo/config/stored.per
\&   if timestamp > 1 hour then alert
.Ve
.PP
As mentioned above, you can also use the timestamp statement for
monitoring directories for changes. If files are added or removed
from a directory, it's timestamp is changed:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check directory mydir path /foo/directory
\&  if timestamp > 1 hour then alert
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check directory myotherdir path /foo/secure/directory
\&  if timestamp < 1 hour then alert
.Ve
.PP
The following example is a hack for restarting a process after a
certain time. Sometimes this is a necessary workaround for some
third-party applications, until the vendor fix a problem:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check file server.pid path /var/run/server.pid
\&       if timestamp > 7 days 
\&          then exec "/usr/local/server/restart-server"
.Ve
.Sh "\s-1FILE\s0 \s-1SIZE\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "FILE SIZE TESTING"
Monit can monitor files for size changes and act on changes. This
test may only be used within a file service entry in the monit
control file.
.PP
The size statement also comes in two flavors. The first and basic
version is simply to test an existing file for size changes and
if changed, execute an action. The second, and more compound,
version is used to test a file for various size changes.
.PP
The full syntax for the size statement is as follows

\&\*(L"\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\*(R".
.PP
The basic size statement is useful for checking a file for
changes and send an alert or execute an action. Monit will
register the size of the file at startup and monitor the file for
changes. One example of use for this statement is to conduct
security checks, for instance:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check file su with path /bin/su
\&       if size was changed then exec "/sbin/ifconfig eth0 down"
.Ve
.PP
which will \*(L"cut the cable\*(R" and stop a possible intruder from
compromising the system further. This test is just one of many
you may use to increase the security awareness on a system. If
you plan to use monit for security reasons we recommend that you
use this test in combination with other supported tests like
checksum, timestamp, and so on.
.PP
The second size version may be useful in different contexts. It
can, for instance, be used to test if a certain file size was
exceeded and then alert you or monit may execute a certain action
specified by you. An example is to use this statement to rotate
log files after they have reached a certain size or to check that
a database file does not grow beyond a specified threshold.
.PP
To rotate a log file:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check file myapp.log with path /var/log/myapp.log
\&    if size > 50 MB then 
\&       exec "/usr/local/bin/rotate /var/log/myapp.log myapp"
.Ve
.PP
where /usr/local/bin/rotate may be a simple script, such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& #/bin/bash
\& /bin/mv $1 $1.`date +%y-%m-%d`
\& /usr/bin/pkill -HUP $2
.Ve
.PP
Or you may use this statement to trigger the \fIlogrotate\fR\|(8)
program, to do an \*(L"emergency\*(R" rotate. Or to send an alert if a
file becomes a known bottleneck if it grows behind a certain size
because of limits in a database engine:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check file mydb with path /data/mydatabase.db
\&       if size > 1 GB then alert
.Ve
.PP
This is a more restrictive form of the first example where the
size is explicitly defined (Note that this is system dependent):
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check file su with path /bin/su
\&       if size != 95564 then exec "/sbin/ifconfig eth0 down"
.Ve
.Sh "\s-1SPACE\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0"

Monit will check a device's total space usage. If you only want
to check available space for non\-superuser, you must set the
watermark appropriately (i.e. total space minus reserved blocks
for the superuser).
.PP
You can obtain (and set) the superuser's reserved blocks size,
for example by using the tune2fs utility on Linux. On Linux 5% of
available blocks are reserved for the superuser by default. To
list the reserved blocks for the superuser:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& [root@berry monit]# tune2fs -l /dev/hda1| grep "Reserved block"

\& Reserved blocks uid:      0 (user root)

On solaris 10% of the blocks are reserved. You can also use
tunefs on solaris to change values on a live filesystem.

.IX Subsection "CONNECTION TESTING"
Monit is able to perform connection testing via networked ports
or via Unix sockets. A connection test may only be used within a
process or within a host service entry in the monit control file.
.PP
If a service listens on one or more sockets, monit can connect to
the port (using either tcp or udp) and verify that the service
will accept a connection and that it is possible to write and
read from the socket. If a connection is not accepted or if there
is a problem with socket read/write, monit will assume that
something is wrong and execute a specified action. If monit is
compiled with openssl, then ssl based network services can also
be tested.
.PP
The full syntax for the statement used for connection testing is
as follows (keywords are in capital and optional statements in
[brackets]),
.IP "\s-1IF\s0 \s-1FAILED\s0 [host] port [type] [protocol|{send/expect}+] [timeout] \s-1THEN\s0 action" 4

.PP
\&\fBhost:HOST hostname\fR. Optionally specify the host to connect
to. If the host is not given then localhost is assumed if this
test is used inside a process entry. If this test was used inside
a remote host entry then the entry's remote host is assumed.
Although \fIhost\fR is intended for testing name based virtual host
in a \s-1HTTP\s0 server running on local or remote host, it does allow
the connection statement to be used to test a server running on
another machine. This may be useful; For instance if you use
Apache httpd as a front-end and an application-server as the
back-end running on another machine, this statement may be used
to test that the back-end server is running and if not raise an
alert.
.PP
\&\fBport:PORT number\fR. The port number to connect to
.PP
\&\fBunixsocket:UNIXSOCKET \s-1PATH\s0\fR. Specifies the path to a Unix
socket. Servers based on Unix sockets, always runs on the local
machine and does not use a port.
.PP
\&\fBtype:TYPE {TCP|UDP|TCPSSL}\fR. Optionally specify the socket type
monit should use when trying to connect to the port. The
different socket types are; \s-1TCP\s0, \s-1UDP\s0 or \s-1TCPSSL\s0, where \s-1TCP\s0 is a
regular stream based socket, \s-1UDP\s0 is a datagram socket and \s-1TCPSSL\s0
specify that monit should use a \s-1TCP\s0 socket with \s-1SSL\s0 when
connecting to a port. The default socket type is \s-1TCP\s0. If \s-1TCPSSL\s0
is used you may optionally specify the \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 protocol to be
used and the md5 sum of the server's certificate. The \s-1TCPSSL\s0
options are:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& TCPSSL [SSLAUTO|SSLV2|SSLV3|TLSV1] [CERTMD5 md5sum]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBproto(col):PROTO {protocols}\fR. Optionally specify the protocol
monit should speak when a connection is established. At the
moment monit knows how to speak \fI\s-1HTTP\s0\fR, \fI\s-1SMTP\s0\fR, \fI\s-1FTP\s0\fR, \fI\s-1POP\s0\fR,
\&\fI\s-1IMAP\s0\fR, \fI\s-1NNTP\s0\fR, \fI\s-1SSH\s0\fR, \fI\s-1DWP\s0\fR, \fI\s-1LDAP2\s0\fR, \fI\s-1LDAP3\s0\fR, \fI\s-1RDATE\s0\fR
and \fI\s-1RSYNC\s0\fR and if you have compiled monit with ssl support,
monit can also speak \fI\s-1HTTPS\s0\fR, \fI\s-1FTPS\s0\fR, \fI\s-1POPS\s0\fR and \fI\s-1IMAPS\s0\fR. If
the server's protocol is not found in this list, simply do not
specify the protocol and monit will utilize a default test,
including testing if it is possible to read and write to the
port. This default test is in most cases more than good enough to
deduce if the server behind the port is up or not. The protocol
statement is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& [PROTO(COL) {name} [REQUEST {"/path"} [with CHECKSUM checksum]]
.Ve
.PP
As you can see, you may specify a request after the protocol, at
the moment only the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol supports the request option.
See also below for an example.
.PP
\&\fBsend/expect: {SEND|EXPECT} \*(L"string\*(R" ...\fR.  If monit does not
support the protocol spoken by the server, you can write your own
protocol-test using \fIsend\fR and \fIexpect\fR strings. The \fI\s-1SEND\s0\fR
statement sends a string to the server port and the \fI\s-1EXPECT\s0\fR
statement compares a newline terminated string read from the
server with the string given in the expect statement. If your
system supports \s-1POSIX\s0 regular expressions, you can use regular
expressions in the expect string, see \fIregex\fR\|(7) to learn more
about the types of regular expressions you can use in an expect
string. Otherwise the string is used as it is. The send/expect
statement is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& [{SEND|EXPECT} "string"]+
.Ve
.PP
Note that monit will send a string as it is, and you \fBmust\fR
remember to include \s-1CR\s0 and \s-1LF\s0 in the string sent to the server if
the protocol expect such characters to terminate a string (most
text based protocols used over Internet does). Likewise monit
will read newline terminated strings from the server or up to 256
bytes from the server and use this string when comparing the
expect string. If the server sends strings terminated by \s-1CRLF\s0,
(i.e. \*(L"\er\en\*(R") you \fImust\fR also remember to add the same
terminating characters to the string you expect from the
server. Finally, send/expect can be used with \s-1TCP\s0 stream sockets
and \s-1UNIX\s0 sockets but \fBnot\fR with \s-1TCP\s0 udp sockets.
.PP
\&\fBtimeout:with \s-1TIMEOUT\s0 x \s-1SECONDS\s0\fR. Optionally specifies the
connect and read timeout for the connection. If monit cannot
connect to the server within this time it will assume that the
connection failed and execute the specified action. The default
connect timeout is 5 seconds.
.PP
\&\fBaction\fR is a choice of \*(L"\s-1ALERT\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1RESTART\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1STOP\s0\*(R", \*(L"\s-1EXEC\s0\*(R" or
\&\*(L"\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\*(R".
.PP
Remote host ping test
.IX Subsection "Remote host ping test"
.PP
In addition monit can perform \s-1ICMP\s0 Echo tests in remote host
checks. The icmp test may only be used in a check host entry and
monit must run with super user privileges, that is, the root user
must run monit. The reason is that the icmp test utilize a raw
socket to send the icmp packet and only the super user is allowed
to create a raw socket.
.PP
The full syntax for the \s-1ICMP\s0 Echo statement used for ping testing
is as follows (keywords are in capital and optional statements in
[brackets]):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  IF FAILED ICMP TYPE ECHO [WITH] [TIMEOUT number SECONDS] 
\&     THEN action
.Ve
.PP
The rules for action and timeout are the same as those mentioned
above in the \s-1CONNECTION\s0 \s-1TESTING\s0 section. An icmp ping test is
useful for testing if a host is up, before testing ports at the
host. If an icmp ping test is used in a check host entry, this
test is run first and if the ping test should fail we assume that
the connection to the host is down and monit does \fInot\fR continue
to test any ports. Here's an example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& check host xyzzy with address xyzzy.org
\&       if failed icmp type echo with timeout 15 seconds 
\&          then alert
\&       if failed port 80 proto http then alert
\&       if failed port 443 type TCPSSL proto http then alert
\&       alert foo@bar
.Ve
.PP
In this case, if the icmp test should fail you will get \fIone\fR
alert and only one alert as long as the host is down, and equally
important, monit will \fInot\fR test port 80 and port 443. Likewise
if the icmp ping test should succeed (again) monit will continue
to test both port 80 and 443.
.PP
Keep in mind though that some firewalls can block icmp packages
and thus render the test useless.
.PP
Examples
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.PP
To check a port connection and receive an alert if monit cannot
connect to the port, use the following statement:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  if failed port 80 then alert
.Ve
.PP
In this case the machine in question is assumed to be the default
host. For a process entry it's \fIlocalhost\fR and for a remote host
entry it's the \fIaddress\fR of the remote host. Monit will conduct
a tcp connection to the host at port 80 and use tcp by default.
If you want to connect with udp, you can specify this after the
port\-statement;
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if failed port 53 type udp then alert
.Ve
.PP
Monit will stop trying to connect to the port after 5 seconds and
assume that the server behind the port is down. You may increase
or decrease the connect timeout by explicit add a connection
timeout. In the following example the timeout is increased to 15
seconds and if monit cannot connect to the server within 15
seconds the test will fail and an alert message is sent.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  if failed port 80 with timeout 15 seconds then alert
.Ve
.PP
If a server is listening to a Unix socket the following statement
can be used:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if failed unixsocket /var/run/sophie then alert
.Ve
.PP
A Unix socket is used by some servers for fast (interprocess)
communication on localhost only. A Unix socket is specified by a
path and in the example above the path, /var/run/sophie,
specifies a Unix socket.
.PP
If your machine answers for several virtual hosts you can prefix
the port statement with a host-statement like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& if failed host www.sol.no port 80 then alert
\& if failed host 80.69.226.133 port 443 then alert
\& if failed host kvasir.sol.no port 80 then alert
.Ve
.PP
And as mentioned above, if you do not specify a host\-statement,
\&\fIlocalhost\fR or \fIaddress\fR is assumed.
.PP
Monit also knows how to speak some of the more popular Internet
protocols. So, besides testing for connections, monit can also
speak with the server in question to verify that the server
works. For example, the following is used to test a http server:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& if failed host www.tildeslash.com port 80 proto http 
\&    then restart
.Ve
.PP
Some protocols also support a request statement. This statement
can be used to ask the server for a special document entity. 
.PP
Currently \fBonly\fR the \fI\s-1HTTP\s0\fR protocol module supports the
request statement, such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& if failed host www.myhost.com port 80 protocol http 
\&    and request "/data/show.php?a=b&c=d"
\& then restart
.Ve
.PP
The request must contain an \s-1URI\s0 string specifying a document from
the http server. The string will be \s-1URL\s0 encoded by monit before
it sends the request to the http server, so it's okay to use \s-1URL\s0
unsafe characters in the request. If the request statement isn't
specified, the default web server page will be requested.
.PP
You can also test the checksum for documents returned by a http
server.  You can use either \s-1MD5\s0 sums:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& if failed port 80 protocol http 
\&    and request "/page.html"
\&        with checksum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659 
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
Or you can use \s-1SHA1\s0 sums:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& if failed port 80 protocol http 
\&    and request "/page.html"
\&        with checksum e428302e260e0832007d82de853aa8edf19cd872 
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
monit will compute a checksum (either \s-1MD5\s0 or \s-1SHA1\s0 is used,
depending on length of the hash) for the document (in the above
case, /page.html) and compare the computed checksum with the
expected checksum. If the sums does not match then the if-tests
action is performed, in this case alert. Note that monit will
\&\fBnot\fR test the checksum for a document if the server does not
set the \s-1HTTP\s0 \fIContent-Length\fR header. A \s-1HTTP\s0 server should set
this header when it server a static document (i.e. a file). A
server will often use chunked transfer encoding instead when
serving dynamic content (e.g. a document created by a CGI-script
or a Servlet), but to test the checksum for dynamic content is
not very useful. There are no limitation on the document size,
but keep in mind that monit will use time to download the
document over the network so it's probably smart not to ask monit
to compute a checksum for documents larger than 1Mb or so,
depending on you network connection of course. Tip; If you get a
checksum error even if the document has the correct sum, the
reason may be that the download timed out. In this case, explicit
set a longer timeout than the default 5 seconds.
.PP
As mentioned above, if the server protocol is not supported by
monit you can write your own protocol test using send/expect
strings. Here we show a protocol test using send/expect for an
imaginary \*(L"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\*(R" protocol:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& if failed host cave.persia.ir port 4040
\&    send "Open, Sesame!\er\en"
\&    expect "Please enter the cave\er\en"
\&    send "Shut, Sesame!\er\en"
\&    expect "See you later [A-Za-z ]+\er\en"
\& then restart
.Ve
.PP
The \fI\s-1TCPSSL\s0\fR statement can optionally test the md5 sum of the
server's certificate. You must state the md5 certificate string
you expect the server to deliver and upon a connect to the
server, the server's actual md5 sum certificate string is
tested. If they do not match, the connection test fails.  If the
ssl version handshake does not work properly you can also force a
specific ssl version, as we demonstrate in this example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& if failed host shop.sol.no port 443 
\&    type TCPSSL SSLV3 # Force monit to use ssl version 3
\&    # We expect the server to return this  md5 certificate sum
\&    CERTMD5 12-34-56-78-90-AB-CD-EF-12-34-56-78-90-AB-CD-EF
\&    protocol http 
\& then restart
.Ve
.PP
Here's an example where a connection test is used inside a
process entry:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/apache.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop program = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed host www.tildeslash.com port 80 then restart
\&       alert foo@bar.baz
.Ve
.PP
Here, a connection test is used in a remote host entry:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check host up2date with address ftp.redhat.com
\&       if failed port 21 and protocol ftp then alert
\&       alert foo@bar.baz
.Ve
.PP
Since we did not explicit specify a host in the above test, monit
will connect to port 21 at ftp.redhat.com. Apropos, the host
address can be specified as a dotted \s-1IP\s0 address string or as
hostname in the \s-1DNS\s0. The following is exactly[*] the same test,
but here an ip address is used instead:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check host up2date with address 66.187.232.30
\&       if failed port 21 and protocol ftp then alert
\&       alert foo@bar.baz
.Ve
.PP
[*] Well, not quite, since we specify an ip-address directly we
will bypass any \s-1DNS\s0 round-robin setup, but that's another story.
.PP
For more examples, see the example section below.
.SH "MONIT HTTPD"
.IX Header "MONIT HTTPD"
If specified in the control file, monit will start a monit daemon
with http support. From a Browser you can then start and stop
services, disable or enable service monitoring as well as view
the status of each service. Also, if monit logs to its own file,
you can view the content of this logfile in a Browser.
.PP
The control file statement for starting a monit daemon with http
support is a global set\-statement:
.IP "set httpd port 2812" 4
.IX Item "set httpd port 2812"
.PP
And you can use this \s-1URL\s0, \fIhttp://localhost:2812/\fR, to access
the daemon from a browser. The port number, in this case 2812,
can be any number that you are allowed to bind to.
.PP
If you have compiled monit with openssl, you can also start the
httpd server with ssl support, using the following expression:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& set httpd port 2812
\&     ssl enable
\&     pemfile /etc/certs/monit.pem
.Ve
.PP
And you can use this \s-1URL\s0, \fIhttps://localhost:2812/\fR, to access
the monit web server over an ssl encrypted connection.
.PP
The pemfile, in the example above, holds both the server's
private key and certificate. This file should be stored in a safe
place on the filesystem and should have strict permissions, that
is, no more than 0700.
.PP
In addition, if you want to check for client certificates you can
use the \s-1CLIENTPEMFILE\s0 statement.  In this case, a connecting
client has to provided a certificate known by monit in order to
connect. This file also needs to have all necessary \s-1CA\s0
certificates. A configuration could look like:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& set httpd port 2812
\&     ssl enable
\&     pemfile /etc/certs/monit.pem
\&     clientpemfile /etc/certs/monit-client.pem
.Ve
.PP
By default self signed client certificates are not allowed. If
you want to use a self signed certificate from a client it has to
be allowed explicitly with the \s-1ALLOWSELFCERTIFICATION\s0 statement.
.PP
For more information on how to use monit with \s-1SSL\s0 and for more
information about certificates and generating pem files, please
consult the \s-1README\s0.SSL file accompanying the software.
.PP
If you only want the http server to accept connect requests to
one host addresses you can specify the bind address either as an
\&\s-1IP\s0 number string or as a hostname. In the following example we
bind the http server to the loopback device. In other words the
http server will only be reachable from localhost:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set httpd port 2812 and use the address 127.0.0.1
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set httpd port 2812 and use the address localhost
.Ve
.PP
If you do not use the \s-1ADDRESS\s0 statement the http server will
accept connections on any/all local addresses.
.PP
It is possible to hide monit's httpd server version, which apears
in the httpd header and error pages under normal circumstances.
This way you can hide the version from users, which don't have
access to monit httpd:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&    ...
\&    signature {enable|disable}
.Ve
.PP
Use \fIdisable\fR to hide the server signature \- monit will only
report its name (e.g. 'monit' instead of for example 'monit
4.2'). By default the version signature is enabled. It is worth
noting that this option provides no security advantage and falls
into the \*(L"security through obscurity\*(R" category.
.PP
If you remove the httpd statement from the config file, monit
will stop the httpd server on configuration reload. Likewise if
you change the port number, monit will restart the http server
using the new specified port number.
.PP
The status page displayed by the monit web server is
automatically refreshed with the same poll time set for the monit
daemon.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR
.PP
We strongly recommend that you start monit with http support (and
bind the server to localhost, only, unless you are behind a
firewall).  The built-in web-server is small and does not use
much resources, and more \fIimportantly\fR, monit can use the http
server for interprocess communication between a monit client and
a monit daemon.
.PP
For instance, you \fImust\fR start a monit daemon with http support
if you want to be able to use the following console
commands. (That is; most of the available console commands).
.PP
.Vb 12
\& 'monit stop all'
\& 'monit start all'
\& 'monit stop service' 
\& 'monit start service' 
\& 'monit restart service' 
\& 'monit monitor service' 
\& 'monit unmonitor service' 
\& 'monit -g groupname stop all'
\& 'monit -g groupname start all'
\& 'monit -g groupname restart all' 
\& 'monit -g groupname monitor all' 
\& 'monit -g groupname unmonitor all'
.Ve
.PP
If a monit daemon is running in the background we will ask the
daemon (via the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol) to execute the above commands.
That is, the daemon is requested to start and stop the services.
This ensures that a daemon will not restart a service that you
requested to stop and that (any) timeout lock will be removed
from a service when you start it. 
.Sh "Monit \s-1HTTPD\s0 Authentication"
.IX Subsection "Monit HTTPD Authentication"
monit supports two types of authentication schema's for connecting
to the httpd server, (three, if you count \s-1SSL\s0 client certificate
validation). Both schema's can be used together or by itself.  You
\&\fBmust\fR choose at least one.
.PP
Host allow list
.IX Subsection "Host allow list"
.PP
The http server maintains an access-control list of hosts allowed
to connect to the server. You can add as many hosts as you want
to, but only hosts with a valid domain name or its \s-1IP\s0 address are
allowed. If you specify a hostname that does not resolve, monit
will write an error message in the console and not start.
.PP
The http server will query a name server to check any hosts
connecting to the server. If a host (client) is trying to connect
to the server, but cannot be found in the access list or cannot
be resolved, the server will shutdown the connection to the
client promptly.
.PP
Control file example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow localhost
\&      allow my.other.work.machine.com
\&      allow 10.1.1.1
.Ve
.PP
Clients, not mentioned in the allow list that tries to connect to
the server are logged with their ip\-address.
.PP
Basic Authentication
.IX Subsection "Basic Authentication"
.PP
This authentication schema is \s-1HTTP\s0 specific and described in more
detail in \s-1RFC\s0 2617.
.PP
In short; a server challenge a client (e.g. a Browser) to send
authentication information (username and password) and if
accepted, the server will allow the client access to the
requested document.
.PP
The biggest weakness with Basic Authentication is that the
username and password is sent in clear-text (i.e. base64 encoded)
over the network. It is therefor recommended that you do not use
this authentication method unless you run the monit http server
with \fIssl\fR support. With ssl support it is completely safe to
use Basic Authentication since \fBall\fR http data, including Basic
Authentication headers will be encrypted.
.PP
monit will use Basic Authentication if an allow statement
contains a username and a password separated with a single ':'
character, like so; \fIallow username:password\fR. The username and
password must be written in clear\-text.
.PP
Alternatively you can use files in \*(L"htpasswd\*(R" format (one
user:passwd entry per line), like so: \fIallow
[cleartext|crypt|md5] /path [users]\fR.  By default cleartext
passwords are read.  In case the passwords are digested it is
necessary to specify the cryptographic method.  In order to
select the users their names can be added to the allow
statement. Otherwise all users are added.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow hauk:password
\&      allow md5 /etc/httpd/htpasswd john paul ringo george
.Ve
.PP
If you use this method together with a host list, then only
clients from the listed hosts will be allowed to connect to the
monit http server and each client will be asked to provide a
username and a password.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow localhost
\&      allow 10.1.1.1
\&      allow hauk:password
.Ve
.PP
If you only want to use Basic Authentication, then just provide
allow entries with username and password, like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow hauk:password
\&      allow admin:password
.Ve
.PP
Finally it is possible to define some users as read\-only. A
read-only user can read the monit web pages but will \fInot\fR get
access to push-buttons and cannot change a service from the web
interface.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow admin:password
\&      allow hauk:password read-only
.Ve
.PP
A user is set to read-only by using the \fIread-only\fR keyword
\&\fBafter\fR username:password. In the above example the user \fIhauk\fR
is defined as a read-only user, while the \fIadmin\fR user has all
access rights.
.PP
\&\s-1NB\s0! a monit client will use the \fIfirst\fR username:password pair
in an allow list and you should \fBnot\fR define the first user as a
read-only user. If you do, monit console commands will not work.
.PP
If you use Basic Authentication it is a good idea to set the
access permission for the control file (~/.monitrc) to only
readable and writable for the user running monit, because the
password is written in clear\-text. (Use this command, /bin/chmod
600 ~/.monitrc). In fact, since monit \fBversion 3.0\fR, monit will
complain and exit if the control file is readable by others.
.PP
Clients trying to connect to the server but supply the wrong
username and/or password are logged with their ip\-address.
.PP
If the monit command line interface is being used at least one
cleartext password is necessary.  Otherwise, the monit command
line interface will not be able to connect to the monit daemon
server.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.IX Header "DEPENDENCIES"
If specified in the control file, monit can do dependency
checking before start, stop, monitoring or unmonitoring of
services. The dependency statement may be used within any service
entries in the monit control file.
.PP
The syntax for the depend statement is simply:
.IP "\s-1DEPENDS\s0 on service[, service [,...]]" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDS on service[, service [,...]]"
.PP
Where \fBservice\fR is a service entry name, for instance \fBapache\fR
or \fBdatafs\fR.
.PP
You may add more than one service name of any type or use more
than one depend statement in an entry.
.PP
Services specified in a \fIdepend\fR statement will be checked
during stop/start/monitor/unmonitor operations. If a service is
stopped or unmonitored it will stop/unmonitor any services that
depends on itself. Likewise, if a service is started, it will
first stop any services that depends on itself and after it is
started, start all depending services again. If the service is to
be monitored (enable monitoring), all services which this service
depends on will be monitored before enabling monitoring of this
service.
.PP
Here is an example where we set up an apache service entry to
depend on the underlying apache binary. If the binary should
change an alert is sent and apache is not monitored anymore. The
rationale is security and that monit should not execute a
possibly cracked apache binary.
.PP
.Vb 8
\& (1) check process apache 
\& (2)    with pidfile "/usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid"
\& (3)    ...
\& (4)    depends on httpd
\& (5)
\& (6) check file httpd with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
\& (7)    if failed checksum then unmonitor
\& (8)    alert foo@bar.baz
.Ve
.PP
The first entry is the process entry for apache shown before
(abbreviated for clarity). The fourth line sets up a dependency
between this entry and the service entry named httpd in line 6. A
depend tree works as follows, if an action is conducted in a
lower branch it will propagate upward in the tree and for every
dependent entry execute the same action. In this case, if the
checksum should fail in line 7 then an unmonitor action is
executed and the apache binary is not checked anymore. But since
the apache process entry depends on the httpd entry this entry
will also execute the unmonitor action. In short, if the checksum
test for the httpd binary file should fail, both the check file
httpd entry and the check process apache entry is set in
un-monitoring mode.
.PP
A dependency tree is a general construct and can be used between
all types of service entries and span many levels and propagate
any supported action (except the exec action which will not
propagate upward in a dependency tree for obvious reasons). 
.PP
Here is another different example. Consider the following common
server setup:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  WEB-SERVER -> APPLICATION-SERVER -> DATABASE -> FILESYSTEM
\&      (a)               (b)             (c)          (d)
.Ve
.PP
You can set dependencies so that the web-server depends on the
application server to run before the web-server starts and the
application server depends on the database server and the
database depends on the file-system to be mounted before it
starts.  See also the example section below for examples using
the depend statement.
.PP
Here we describe how monit will function with the above
dependencies:
.IP "If no servers are running" 4
.IX Item "If no servers are running"
monit will start the servers in the following order: \fId\fR, \fIc\fR,
\&\fIb\fR, \fIa\fR
.IP "If all servers are running" 4
.IX Item "If all servers are running"
When you run 'monit stop all' this is the stop order: \fIa\fR, \fIb\fR,
\&\fIc\fR, \fId\fR. If you run 'monit stop d' then \fIa\fR, \fIb\fR and \fIc\fR
are also stopped because they depend on \fId\fR and finally \fId\fR is
stopped.
.IP "If \fIa\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If a does not run"
When monit runs it will start \fIa\fR
.IP "If \fIb\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If b does not run"
When monit runs it will first stop \fIa\fR then start \fIb\fR and
finally start \fIa\fR again.
.IP "If \fIc\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If c does not run"
When monit runs it will first stop \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR then start \fIc\fR
and finally start \fIb\fR then \fIa\fR.
.IP "If \fId\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If d does not run"
When monit runs it will first stop \fIa\fR, \fIb\fR and \fIc\fR then start
\&\fId\fR and finally start \fIc\fR, \fIb\fR then \fIa\fR.
.IP "If the control file contains a depend loop." 4
.IX Item "If the control file contains a depend loop."
A depend loop is for example; a\->b and b\->a or a\->b\->c\->a.
.Sp
When monit starts it will check for such loops and complain and
exit if a loop was found. It will also exit with a complaint if a
depend statement was used that does not point to a service in the
control file.
.SH "THE RUN CONTROL FILE"
.IX Header "THE RUN CONTROL FILE"
The preferred way to set up monit is to write a \fI.monitrc\fR file
in your home directory.  When there is a conflict between the
command-line arguments and the arguments in this file, the
command-line arguments take precedence. To protect the security
of your control file and passwords the control file must have
permissions \fIno more than 0700\fR (u=xrw,g=,o=); monit will
complain and exit otherwise.
.Sh "Run Control Syntax"
.IX Subsection "Run Control Syntax"
Comments begin with a '#' and extend through the end of the line.
Otherwise the file consists of a series of service entries or
global option statements in a free\-format, token-oriented syntax.
.PP
There are three kinds of tokens: grammar keywords, numbers (i.e.
decimal digit sequences) and strings. Strings can be either
quoted or unquoted. A quoted string is bounded by double quotes
and may contain whitespace (and quoted digits are treated as a
string).  An unquoted string is any whitespace-delimited token,
containing characters and/or numbers.
.PP
On a semantic level, the control file consists of two types of
entries:
.IP "1. Global set-statements" 4
.IX Item "1. Global set-statements"
A global set-statement starts with the keyword \fIset\fR and the
item to configure.
.IP "2. One or more service entry statements." 4
.IX Item "2. One or more service entry statements."
Each service entry consists of the keywords `check', followed by
the service type. Each entry requires a <unique> descriptive
name. This name is used by monit to refer to the service
internally and in all interactions with the user.
.PP
Currently, five types of check statements are supported:
.IP "1. \s-1CHECK\s0 \s-1PROCESS\s0 <unique name> \s-1PIDFILE\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "1. CHECK PROCESS <unique name> PIDFILE <path>"
<path> is the absolute path to the program's pidfile. If the
pidfile does not exist or does not contain the pid number of a
running process, monit will call the entry's start method if
defined, If monit runs in passive mode or the start methods is
not defined, monit will just send alerts on errors.
.IP "2. \s-1CHECK\s0 \s-1FILE\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "2. CHECK FILE <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the absolute path to the file. If the file does not
exist or disappeared, monit will call the entry's start method if
defined, if <path> does not point to a regular file type (for
instance a directory), monit will disable monitoring of this
entry. If monit runs in passive mode or the start methods is not
defined, monit will just send alerts on errors.
.IP "3. \s-1CHECK\s0 \s-1DEVICE\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "3. CHECK DEVICE <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the path to the device block special file, mount point,
file or a directory which is part of a filesystem. It is
recommended to use a block special file directly (for example
/dev/hda1 on Linux or /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s1 on Solaris, etc.) If you
use a mount point (for example /data), be careful, because if the
device is unmounted the test will still be true because the mount
point exist.
.Sp
If the device becomes unavailable, monit will call the entry's
start method if defined. if <path> does not point to a device,
monit will disable monitoring of this entry. If monit runs in
passive mode or the start methods is not defined, monit will just
send alerts on errors.
.IP "4. \s-1CHECK\s0 \s-1DIRECTORY\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "4. CHECK DIRECTORY <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the absolute path to the directory. If the directory
does not exist or disappeared, monit will call the entry's start
method if defined, if <path> does not point to a directory, monit
will disable monitoring of this entry. If monit runs in passive
mode or the start methods is not defined, monit will just send
alerts on errors.
.IP "5. \s-1CHECK\s0 \s-1HOST\s0 <unique name> \s-1ADDRESS\s0 <host address>" 4
.IX Item "5. CHECK HOST <unique name> ADDRESS <host address>"
The host address can be specified as a hostname string or as an
ip-address string on a dotted decimal format. Such as,
tildeslash.com or \*(L"64.87.72.95\*(R".
.PP
You can use noise keywords like 'if', `and', `with(in)', `has',
`using', 'use', 'on(ly)', `usage' and `program(s)' anywhere in an
entry to make it resemble English. They're ignored, but can make
entries much easier to read at a glance. The punctuation
characters ';' ',' and '=' are also ignored. Keywords are case
insensitive.

\& request         Specifies a server request and must come
\&                 after the protocol keyword mentioned above.
\&                  - for http it can contain an URL and an
\&                    optional query string.
\&                  - other protocols does not support this
\&                    statement yet
\& send/expect     These keywords specify a generic protocol. 
\&                 Both require a string whether to be sent or
\&                 to be matched against (as extended regex if 
\&                 supported).  Send/expect can not be used together
\&                 with the proto(col) statement.
\& unix(socket)    Specifies a Unix socket file and used like 
\&                 the port statement above to test a Unix 
\&                 domain network socket connection.
\& timeout x sec.  Define a network port connection timeout. Must
\&                 be followed by a number in seconds and the 
\&                 keyword, seconds.
\& timeout         Define a service timeout. Must be followed by
\&                 two digits. The first digit is max number of
\&                 restarts for the service. The second digit
\&                 is the cycle interval to test restarts. 
\&                 This statement is optional.
\& alert           Specifies an email address for notification
\&                 if a service event occurs. Alert can also
\&                 be postfixed, to only send a message for
\&                 certain events. See the examples above. More
\&                 than one alert statement is allowed in an
\&                 entry. This statement is also optional.
\& restart, stop   These keywords may be used as actions for 
\& unmonitor and   various test statements. The exec statement is
\& exec            special in that it requires a following string
\&                 specifying the program to be execute. You may
\&                 also specify an UID and GID for the exec 
\&                 statement. The program executed will then run
\&                 using the specified user id and group id.
\& mail-format     Specifies a mail format for an alert message 
\&                 This statement is an optional part of the
\&                 alert statement.
\& checksum        Specify that monit should compute and monitor a
\&                 file's md5/sha1 checksum. May only be used in a 
\&                 check file entry.
\& expect          Specifies a md5/sha1 checksum string monit should
\&                 expect when testing the checksum. This statement
\&                 is an optional part of the checksum statement.
\& timestamp       Specifies an expected timestamp for a file
\&                 or directory. More than one timestamp statement
\&                 are allowed. May only be used in a check file or
\&                 check directory entry.
\& changed         Part of a timestamp statement and used as an
\&                 operator to simply test for a timestamp change.
\& every           Validate this entry only at every n poll cycle.
\&                 Useful in daemon mode when the cycle is short
\&                 and a service takes some time to start.
\& mode            Must be followed either by the keyword active,
\&                 passive or manual. If active, monit will restart
\&                 the service if it is not running (this is the
\&                 default behavior). If passive, monit will not
\&                 (re)start the service if it is not running - it
\&                 will only monitor and send alerts (resource
\&                 related restart and stop options are ignored
\&                 in this mode also). If manual, monit will enter
\&                 active mode only if a service was started under
\&                 monit's control otherwise the service isn't
\&                 monitored.
\& cpu             Must be followed by a compare operator, a number 
\&                 with "%", optionally a maximum number of cycles 
\&                 and an action. This statement is used to check 
\&                 the cpu usage in percent of a process with it's 
\&                 children over a number of cycles.  If the 
\&                 compare expression matches then the specified
\&                 action is executed.
\& mem             The equivalent to the cpu token for memory of a 
\&                 process (w/o children!).  This token must be 
\&                 followed by a compare operator a number with 
\&                 unit {B|KB|MB|GB|%|byte|kilobyte|megabyte|
\&                 gigabyte|percent}, optionally a maximum number 
\&                 of cycles and an action.
\& loadavg         Must be followed by [1min,5min,15min] in (), a 
\&                 compare operator, a number, optionally a maximum
\&                 number of cycles and an action.  This statement
\&                 is used to check the system load average over a
\&                 number of cycles. If the compare expression
\&                 matches then the specified action is executed.
\& children        This is the number of child processes spawn by a
\&                 process. The syntax is the same as above.
\& totalmem        The equivalent of mem, except totalmem is an
\&                 aggregation of memory, not only used by a
\&                 process but also by all it's child
\&                 processes. The syntax is the same as above.
\& space           Must be followed by a compare operator, a
\&                 number, unit {B|KB|MB|GB|%|byte|kilobyte|
\&                 megabyte|gigabyte|percent} and an action.
\& inode(s)        Must be followed by a compare operator, integer
\&                 number, optionally by percent sign (if not, the
\&                 limit is absolute) and an action.
\& perm(ission)    Must be followed by an octal number describing
\&                 the permissions.
\& size            Must be followed by a compare operator, a

check to see if the server is running and log a message if not:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& check process resin with pidfile /usr/local/resin/srun.pid

.PP
To have monit start the server if it's not running, add a start

Here's a more advanced example for monitoring an apache
web-server listening on the default port number for \s-1HTTP\s0 and
\&\s-1HTTPS\s0. In this example monit will restart apache if it's not
accepting connections at the port numbers. The method monit use
for a process restart is to first execute the stop\-program, wait
for the process to stop and then execute the start\-program. (If
monit was unable to stop or start the service a failed alert
message will be sent if you have requested alert messages to be
sent).
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop program  = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed port 80 then restart
\&       if failed port 443 with timeout 15 seconds then restart
.Ve
.PP
This example demonstrate how you can run a program as a specified
user (uid) and with a specified group (gid). Many daemon programs
will do the uid and gid switch by them self, but for those
programs that does not (e.g. Java programs), monit's ability to
start a program as a certain user can be very useful.  In this
example we start the Tomcat Java Servlet Engine as the standard
\&\fInobody\fR user and group. Please note that monit will only switch
uid and gid for a program if the super-user is running monit,
otherwise monit will simply ignore the request to change uid and
gid.

In this example we use udp for connection testing to check if the
name-server is running and also use timeout and alert:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& check process named with pidfile /var/run/named.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/named start"

The following example illustrate how to check if the service
\&'sophie' is answering connections on its Unix domain socket:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check process sophie with pidfile /var/run/sophie.pid

.Ve
.PP
In this example we check an apache web-server running on
localhost that answers for several IP-based virtual hosts or
vhosts, hence the host statement before port:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop  "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed host www.sol.no port 80 then alert
\&       if failed host shop.sol.no port 443 then alert
\&       if failed host chat.sol.no port 80 then alert
\&       if failed host www.tildeslash.com port 80 then alert
.Ve
.PP
To make sure that monit is communicating with a http server a
protocol test can be added:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop  "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed host www.sol.no port 80 
\&          protocol HTTP
\&          then alert
.Ve
.PP
This example shows a different way to check a webserver using
the send/expect mechanism:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop  "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed host www.sol.no port 80 
\&          send "GET / HTTP/1.0\er\enHost: www.sol.no\er\en\er\en"
\&          expect "HTTP/[0-9\e.]{3} 200 .*\er\en"
\&          then alert
.Ve
.PP
Here we use an icmp ping test to check if a remote host is up and
if not send an alert:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check host www.tildeslash.com with address www.tildeslash.com
\&       if failed icmp type echo with timeout 15 seconds
\&          then alert
\&       alert foo@bar.org
.Ve
.PP
In the following example we ask monit to compute and verify the
checksum for the underlying apache binary used by the start and
stop programs. If the the checksum test should fail, monitoring
will be disabled to prevent possibly starting a compromised
binary:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop program  = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed host www.tildeslash.com port 80 then restart
\&       depends on apache_bin
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check file apache_bin with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
\&       if failed checksum then unmonitor
\&       alert foo@bar.baz
.Ve
.PP
In this example we ask monit to test the checksum for a document
on a remote server. If the checksum was changed we send an alert:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& check host tildeslash with address www.tildeslash.com
\&       if failed port 80 protocol http 
\&          and request "/monit/dist/monit-4.0.tar.gz"
\&              with checksum f9d26b8393736b5dfad837bb13780786
\&       then alert with mail-format { subject: Aaaalarm! }
\&       alert hauk@tildeslash.com
.Ve
.PP
Some servers are slow starters, like for example Java based
Application Servers. So if we want to keep the poll-cycle low
(i.e. < 60 seconds) but allow some services to take its time to
start, the \fBevery\fR statement is handy:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process dynamo with pidfile /etc/dynamo.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/dynamo start"
\&       stop program  = "/etc/init.d/dynamo stop"
\&       if failed port 8840 then alert
\&       every 2 cycles
.Ve
.PP
Here is an example where we group together two database entries
so you can manage them together, e.g.; 'monit \-g database start
all'. The mode statement is also illustrated in the first entry
and have the effect that monit will not try to (re)start this
service if it is not running:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process sybase with pidfile /var/run/sybase.pid
\&       start = "/etc/init.d/sybase start"

\&       alert bofh@foo.bar
\&       group database
.Ve

Here is an example to show the usage of the resource checks. It
will send an alert when the \s-1CPU\s0 usage of the http daemon and it's
child processes raises beyond 60% for over two cycles. Apache is
restarted if the \s-1CPU\s0 usage is over 80% for five cycles or the
memory usage over 100Mb for five cycles or if the machines load
average is more than 10 for 8 cycles:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop program  = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if cpu > 60% for 2 cycles then alert
\&       if cpu > 80% for 5 cycles then restart
\&       if mem > 100 MB for 5 cycles then stop
\&       if loadavg(5min) greater than 10.0 for 8 cycles then stop
.Ve

This examples demonstrate the timestamp statement with exec and
how you may restart apache if it's configuration file was
changed.

In this example, we demonstrate usage of the depend statement. In
this case, we want to start oracle and apache. However, we've set
up apache to use oracle as a back end, and if oracle is restarted,
apache must be restarted as well.
.PP
.Vb 4

.Sh "Handling state"
.IX Subsection "Handling state"
As mentioned elsewhere, monit save its state to a state file. If
the monit process should die, upon restart monit will read its
last known state from this file. This can be a problem if monit
is used in a cluster, as illustrate in this scenario:
.IP "1" 4
.IX Item "1"
The active node fails, the second takes over
.IP "2" 4
.IX Item "2"
After a reboot, the failed node comes back, monit read its state
file and start all the services (even manual ones) as they were
running before the failure. This is a problem because services
will now run on both nodes.
.PP
The solution to this problem is to remove the monit.state file in
a rc-script called at boot time and before monit is started. 
.SH "FILES"

   file will be used instead.
.PP
\&\fI./monitrc\fR  
   If the control file is not found in either of the
   previous two locations, and the current working

   used instead.
.PP
\&\fI~/.monitrc.pid\fR

.PP
\&\fI/etc/monit.pid\fR
   Lock file to help prevent concurrent runs (root mode,
   systems without /var/run).
.PP
\&\fI~/.monit.state\fR  
   monit save its state to this file and utilize 
   information found in this file to recover from 
   a crash. This is a binary file and it's content is 
   only of interest to monit. You may set the location
   of this file in the monit control file or by using 
   the \-s switch when monit is started.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
No environment variables are used by monit. However, when monit
execute a script or a program monit will set several environment
variables which can be utilized by the executable. The following
and \fIonly\fR the following environment variables are available:
.IP "\s-1MONIT_EVENT\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_EVENT"
The event that occurred on the service
.IP "\s-1MONIT_SERVICE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_SERVICE"
The name of the service (from monitrc) on which the event occurred.
.IP "\s-1MONIT_DATE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_DATE"
The time and date (rfc 822 style) the event occurred
.IP "\s-1MONIT_HOST\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_HOST"
The host the event occurred on
.PP
The following environment variables are only available for
process service entries:
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_PID\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_PID"
The process pid. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_MEMORY\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_MEMORY"
Process memory. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_CHILDREN\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_CHILDREN"
Process children. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_CPU_PERCENT\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_CPU_PERCENT"
Process cpu%. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.PP
In addition the following spartan \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable is
available:
.IP "PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin" 4
.IX Item "PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin"
.PP
Scripts or programs that depends on other environment variables
or on a more verbose \s-1PATH\s0 must provide means to set these
variables by them self.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.IX Header "SIGNALS"
If a monit daemon is running, \s-1SIGUSR1\s0 wakes it up from its sleep
phase and forces a poll of all services. \s-1SIGTERM\s0 and \s-1SIGINT\s0 will
gracefully terminate a monit daemon. The \s-1SIGTERM\s0 signal is sent
to a monit daemon if monit is started with the \fIquit\fR action
argument.
.PP
Sending a \s-1SIGHUP\s0 signal to a running monit daemon will force
the daemon to reinitialize itself, specifically it will reread
configuration, close and reopen log files.
.PP
Running monit in foreground while a background monit daemon is
running will wake up the daemon.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
This is a very silent program. Use the \-v switch if you want to
see what monit is doing, and tail \-f the logfile. Optionally for
testing purposes; you can start monit with the \-Iv switch. Monit
will then print debug information to the console, to stop monit
in this mode, simply press CTRL^C (i.e. \s-1SIGINT\s0) in the same
console.
.PP
The syntax (and parser) of the control file is inspired by Eric
S. Raymond et al. excellent fetchmail program. Some portions of
this man page does also receive inspiration from the same
authors.
