QUICK START
-----------

This readme serves as a quick start, please use `man monit' for
documentation on the program.


Installation:
-------------

  -  ./configure
  -  make
  -  make install
  -  man monit

This will install monit and the man-file in /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/man/man1 respectively. If you want another location than
/usr/local, run configure with the prefix options, like so:
./configure --prefix=<dir>


Notes:
------

- This directory contains an example monit control file, called
  monitrc. Please read it and use it as a starting point when you
  write your own monit control file.

- monit will probably work on most Unix systems. However, monit is
  tested and known to compile and operate on; Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
  and Solaris. See also the PLATFORMS file.

- If you are upgrading from a previous monit version and experience
  problems with the monit control file, please consult the UPGRADE.txt
  file accompanying the software.
