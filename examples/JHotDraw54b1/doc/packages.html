The framework package includes the classes and interfaces that define the
JHotDraw framework. It doesn't provide any concrete implementation classes.

<h2><a href=../javadoc/Package-CH.ifa.draw.standard.html>CH.ifa.draw.standard</a></h2>
The standard package provides standard implementations of the classes
defined in the framework package.
