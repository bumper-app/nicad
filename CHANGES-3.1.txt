Changes from NiCad 3.0 in 3.1

1. NiCad 3.0 reported clone classes (when requested by the
   "cluster=yes" configuration parameter) as the largest set 
   of clone pairs for which every source fragment is within 
   the threshold distance of at least one other member of the set.

   This leads to duplications of fragments in the report,
   so now in NiCad 3.1 each fragement in the set is reported once
   even though the definition of cluster remains the same. 

   This means the format of the report has also changed,
   instead of <class> elements containing <clone> pair elements,
   the clustered results now report <class> elements directly
   containing <source> elements.

2. Refactored grammars to make common abstractions easier.
   Abstraction nonterminals now supported for C, C#, Java, Python: 

   block - all blocks, including function bodies
   declaration - all data declarations
   statement - all statements
   expression - all expressions
   condition - all if/while conditions
   literal - all literal constant values
